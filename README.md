### Welcome here!

It feels good to know that you are reading this!

My name is Ali Sepahvand aka alixsep. If you wonder where this nickname came from, well that is "ali" + "x" + "sep" (sep is first 3 letters of sepahvand, also the x has no meaning it's just a letter because alisep account usernames were taken).

Anyways, my main activity is frontend developing with React.js and I have a few other unrelated hobbies as well, such as music production.

My intention is to be helpful to every generation that i am alive among, and only reason for it is that this is the way I enjoy my time. I'm not a hero, and its not my duty to be helpful, but I rather use my skills on good purpose than wasting them.

My favorite project is yugilife web app. I have explaind why in its about page.

Not gonna make this a biography book haha,
Enjoy your time with my repos :)

love,
Alixsep
