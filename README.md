### Welcome here!

It feels good to know you're reading this!

My name is Ali Sepahvand, also known as alixsep. If you're wondering where this nickname came from, it's a combination of "ali" and the first three letters of my last name, "sep". I added an "x" in between too, because my preferred username "alisep" was already taken on most platforms.

I specialize in frontend development with React.js, but I also have other hobbies such as music production. My goal is to be helpful to people of all ages and backgrounds, and I find great joy in doing so. My favorite project is the Yugilife web app, which I've explained in detail on its about page.

Not going to make this a biography book haha,
Enjoy your time with my repos :)

Best regards,
Alixsep
