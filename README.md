### Welcome here!

It feels good to know you're reading this!

My name is Ali Sepahvand, also known as alixsep. If you're wondering where this nickname came from, it's a combination of "ali" and the first three letters of my last name, "sep". I added an "x" in between too, because my preferred username "alisep" was already taken on most platforms.
I specialize in frontend development with React.js, but I also have other hobbies such as music production. My goal is to be helpful to people of all ages and backgrounds, and I find great joy in doing so. My favorite project is the Yugilife web app, which I've explained in detail on its about page.
My intention is to be helpful to every generation that i am alive among, and only reason for it is that this is the way I enjoy my time. I'm not a hero, and its not my duty to be helpful, but I rather use my skills on good purpose than wasting them.

Not going to make this a biography book haha,
Enjoy your time with my repos :)

Best regards,
Alixsep
