### yo fucker, whats up?

so you actually clicked on this? bold move, friend. let me bless your eyeballs with some straight facts.

i'm the best react.js developer in the world. doubt it? hah, my name's ali sepahvand, you can call me Alixsep the fucking goat.

that 'x' between my first and last name makes me sound 0.1% cooler. you know what's even cooler? when i'm not busy turning coffee into code, i'm probably making music that only i think is fire, but let's be real, my raps are objectively better than your top 5 spotify artists for a fact! wanna know my life's mission? to make the world a better place (cap). wanna see some dope shit? check out yugilife - my best project yet which is probably as confused about its purpose as i am about life. are you triggered snowflake? did you expect some normal ass readme on my github? well i am not a loser like you, get off that weak shit and go star and check my repos. or don't. your choice. no pressure. neither of us understand a single line of their source code anyways.
