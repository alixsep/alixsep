### Yo, What's Up?

So you actually clicked on this? Bold move, friend. Let me bless your eyeballs with some straight facts.

Name's Ali Sepahvand, but since the internet is full of usernames stolen by bots and people who peaked in 2012, I go by alixsep. Yep, that 'x' is there because "alisep" was taken, and also because it makes me sound 0.1% cooler.

I use React.js. When I'm not busy turning coffee into code, I'm probably making music that only I think are fire. My life's mission? To make the world a better place (cap). If you want to see my pride and joy, check out Yugilife - my magnum opus that's probably as confused about its purpose as I am about life.

But hey, I'm not here to write my autobiography. Ain't nobody got time for that shit.

Go poke around my repos. Or donâ€™t. Your choice, no pressure.

Stay savage,
Alixsep
